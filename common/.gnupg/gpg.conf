# Group names may be defined like this:
#   group mynames = paige 0x12345678 joe patti
#
# Any time 'mynames' is a recipient (-r or --recipient), it will be
# expanded to the names 'paige', 'joe', and 'patti', and the key ID
# '0x12345678'. Note there is only one level of expansion, i.e. you
# cannot make a group that points to another group. Note also that
# if there are spaces in the recipient name, this will appear as two
# recipients. In these cases it is better to use the key ID.
# group mynames = paige 0x12345678 joe patti
